## [2026-04-26] seed | Initial LLM wiki scaffold

Created Codex-ready wiki seed for Bus Priority Impact Studio. Added project, data, engineering, analysis, template pages, source registry, source manifest, and starter scripts.

Next required action: validate source metadata and schemas with Socrata/API probes before implementation.

## [2026-04-26] research | Managed services options

Added [[wiki/project/managed_services_options|Managed services options]] decision memo covering Cloudflare, Neon, Supabase, Turso, Railway, Render, Fly.io, and a VPS baseline. Recommendation: keep heavy analytics local, serve the public MVP on Cloudflare Pages/Workers/D1/R2, and reserve Neon Postgres/PostGIS for dynamic geospatial upgrades.
## [2026-04-26] architecture | TypeScript package structure and wiki relocation

Added `wiki/engineering/package_structure.md`, moved the prior LLM wiki under repo-level `knowledge/`, added root `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`, and updated engineering docs to use a TypeScript-only MVP with Cloudflare Workers/D1/R2 and local pipeline jobs instead of Python/FastAPI/Postgres.

## [2026-04-27] architecture | Bun-first repo basics, Zod contracts, and test harnesses

Converted the repo blueprint from pnpm-first to Bun-first, added strict TypeScript and Biome configs, scaffolded Zod v4 domain/source/DB contracts, added Bun unit tests, added a Cloudflare Worker runtime test harness, added optimized pre-push hooks, and documented the testing/TDD standards in [[wiki/engineering/testing_standards|Testing standards]].

## [2026-04-27] architecture | Explicit package barrel exports

Added a package barrel export rule: package root `src/index.ts` files must use explicit named re-exports, keep type-only exports as `export type`, and avoid wildcard or namespace re-exports so public APIs stay small and tree-shaking remains predictable.

## [2026-04-27] architecture | Test placement standard

Standardized test placement outside production `src/` trees. Package and pipeline unit tests live in sibling `test/` directories, Worker runtime tests live under `apps/web/test/`, and only cross-cutting architecture harnesses live in root `tests/`.

## [2026-04-27] data | Full source probe completed

Implemented the TypeScript/Bun source manifest probe and validated all 30 manifest sources. Probe result: 30 active, 0 blocked, 0 skipped. Generated Socrata metadata, columns, row counts, HTTP metadata for web/PDF/GTFS sources, and redacted Bus Time GTFS-RT probe outputs under `knowledge/raw/metadata/`. Updated the source registry and data wiki pages with confirmed field names, row counts, and update timestamps.

## [2026-04-27] data | M1 route slice ingestion

Added a fixture-backed Socrata row-query client and `bun run ingest:m1` pipeline command. The first live slice fetched M1 March 2026 data: 2,003 segment-speed rows, 6 active route-shape rows, 134 current stop rows, and 15 timepoint stops. Raw and normalized outputs are local/generated under ignored `data/raw/route-slices/` and `data/working/route-slices/`.

## [2026-04-27] analysis | M1 hotspot scoring

Added deterministic segment hotspot scoring in `packages/analytics` and a fixture-backed `bun run hotspots:m1` pipeline command. The first live artifact for M1 March 2026 scored 2,003 segment-speed observations across 13 timepoint segments, wrote ignored artifacts under `data/artifacts/route-slices/m1-2026-03/`, and identified two top-scoring segments at score 47: southbound `5 AV/E 72 ST` to `5 AV/W 41 ST`, and northbound `4 AV/E 10 ST` to `MADISON AV/E 28 ST`.

## [2026-04-27] analysis | Ridership-weighted M1 hotspots

Extended `ingest:m1` to fetch grouped MTA Bus Hourly Ridership for the route/month and write normalized route/day/hour ridership under ignored `data/working/route-slices/`. Extended hotspot scoring with rider-impact ranking using route-level hourly ridership exposure. The M1 March 2026 slice has 168 ridership windows and 207,870 route-month riders; the top rider-impact segment is northbound `MADISON AV/E 28 ST` to `MADISON AV/E 58 ST` with speed-only score 43 and rider-impact score 63.
